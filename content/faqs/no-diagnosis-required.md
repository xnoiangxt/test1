What are the requirements to participate? Do I need to have a PTSD diagnosis?


A1) Eligible participants are those experiencing PTSD symptoms that seem stuck, excessive, uncontrollable or inappropriate to the situations while they experience their symptoms.

A2) Being able to self care is required-- being able to physically bathe and be mobile and usually of sound frame of mind and behavior. Not needing emergent care, currently.

B) PTSD Diagnosis is NOT a requirement; merely experiencing the symptoms of PTSD or trauma. For instance, health care workers are often subject to symptoms because of job exposure to traumatic situations for Police/Fire/Emergency responders.
