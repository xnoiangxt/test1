Can I stop at any time? Will I get a full refund? How often/long can I participate?


A) Yes, you can stop at any time. This is actually encouraged-- you are in complete control. We hope to have at least one, and preferrably three sessions, for feedback and you becoming comfortable with following the custom system instructions.

B1) Eligible money less expenses will be refunded. There will be a nominal non-refundable fee for registration ($70-$120 USD), and the cost of the instructions or insurance if applicable are due at time of order.

B2) Refunds are yours to keep provided proper feedback was/is given ($50 value) in a reasonable amount of time (~30 days).

C1) Frequency is ideally recommended once every 8 days and 3 times/month. 

C2) How long depends upon how close to the Alpha 2022 program closing (no date yet set) you begin. The sooner you start the longer you can participate. Once the program has sufficient time for data collection it will close. Estimating a minimum of 1 to 3 sessions or maximum of 3 months for the last participants registered.
