How do I sign up? Support your efforts?


A) When the web application is completely available, those taking the (optional) Alpha 2022 survey will be notified first to sign up-- providing qualifications are met. Then remaining limited positions will be filled on a first come first serve basis, as long as there is a category the candidates fulfill. There will be a limited number of Categories and participants. Every effort will be to fill all categories; re-arranging the participants categorical assignment, will make possible a greater participation.

B1) Sign up for the Alpha 2022 pre-screening survey or the News letter (sign up coming soon)

B2) Share with those who may benefit/participate.
