Are there any costs to participate?

The participant is required to self fund their participation and insurance to the alpha program. No estimate at this time on insurance. Instructions for the system are given as the participant desires to work an issue of trauma. Each instruction set will cost $100; first time $120 where $20 is for required equipment. A refund of up to 50% is given for the quality of feedback details. Results do not need to be positive, just honest and sufficiently detailed, for a refund.
