Are there any age restrictions for using this system? Any physical restrictions?


A) At this time the youngest participant is just ten (10) years old and the maximum is fifty (50) years old. As long as current local laws in the USA allow youth to make personal decisions, they can elect to participate. We recommend and encourage parental permission and support when it is not conflicting with the youth's participation, where the parent(s) aren't involved in the trauma such that involvement supports the safety of the participant.


B) For physical requirements: One must be fit for self care-- bathing, dressing, communication, and basic mobility-- bending, walking and standing.
