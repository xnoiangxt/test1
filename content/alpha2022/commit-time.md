Commit to the Alpha 2022 program one to three times at a minimum, for about a few hours each week (usually done in one day) for following the custom system instructions. At most, three times per month, ideally once each 8 days to perform the system instructions in the safe space described earlier.
Commit your time with intent to be involved-- you will get out the quality proportionally on how well you can self-discover and participate in the system.
